Daily Task Manager is designed to be a Task Manager for a user to be able to create Tasks as well as mark them off their List like a regular Checklist would do for your daily routine. 

I took great pride in creating this project, it feels powerful to be able to create an app to do exactly what I do to conquer my days in my life! 

A quick walkthrough of how to get around the app will be included in the read me: [](http://https://github.com/gsmith77/DailyTaskManager/blob/master/README.md)

A huge tip for next Project will be writing out my App before writing a single line of code. This will allow me to understand how every route, view, controller, model, database should be set up. Otherwise I will be running into the same trials and tribulations. Happy Coding guys! Make sure to take pride in your work :)
