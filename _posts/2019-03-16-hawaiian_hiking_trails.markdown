Back on February 21st, 2019, I took a place across the Pacific Ocean to get to Hawai'i where I would spend 8 days relaxing and vacationing with my friend, Chely. I have been three times including this recent trip. Nothing makes me happier than getting on a plane and seeing Hawai'i out the window of the airplane as you get close! Seeing the breathtaking water, all the mountains asking to be climbed by you, and the stress free environment that Hawai'i is so grounded on keeping part of their culture. Hawai'i is one of my favorite spots on the Earth and I can see in my future that I will go there at least a dozen or more times, even live there one day if I chose so, hey maybe I can get a programming career out there! 

That is a little background on why I decided to make my Sinatra App about my trails that I experienced this last time during my trip. I went on several hikes, two that are considered 'closed' to the public because of the riskiness of the climb with, slippery slopes and falling rocks. Yet Chely, the local, and I continued on and had amazing days seeing the sights that people would absolutely love to see! Hawai'i is a place that everyone should and must visit! When you get there though remember one important thing... remember to 'Spred the Aloha'! 

If you're ever in Hawai'i you can sign up and keep track of all your hikes with my app, the repository is right here and it has instructions on how to install and use the app in the ReadMe.
