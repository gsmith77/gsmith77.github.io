Beginning this journey of becoming a Programmer I have learned so many languages and techniques to get failures solved and to clean up my previous arbitrary code. Like anything you start at the bottom learning from the ground up diving into subjects heavily. Whenever the ActiveRecord gem was introduced into the curriculum it was like wait a second, you are saying I only have to do call `[class name] < ActiveRecord::Base` and I get new methods already built in by only including ActiveRecord in my class! It is crazy the magic that ActiveRecord gives us as programmers! 

Also learning Rack and Sinatra has been an intriguing ride and I am honestly having so much fun learning it! I currently am learning Rack and how it deals with creating dynamic routes for the internet. I know that Flatiron is very well structured by the way we learn. Knowing what is going on behind the scenes so we can understand the magic.
