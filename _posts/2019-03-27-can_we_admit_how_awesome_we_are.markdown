I am talking to my Dad about how I am super excited to learn Ruby on Rails! Ruby on Rails is a testimonial into the programming world, I mean we are seriously learning what Instagram (a.k.a. The Gram), Twiiter, and Facebook! Thinking on that note, the trail through this curriculum has been an amazing one! I seriously am so grateful to myself that I chose Flatiron School over anyother Bootcamp there is to offer! Flatiron is the only School to publish its job ratings and have them backed up by a Third Party to verify every detail that it is correct. No other school has done that... ONLY Flatiron! Flatiron is something I can proudly say I am a part of and seriously the name Flatiron School is badass as they come in names to me! I feel like our flag would be a white banner with a soft light blue cross like a knight's vibe on a flag if ya feels... just a thought. Also I have learned more in this curriculum about one subject, including thinking in a total different way, from this course over any shooling or interests! 

The fact that ActiveRecord is inside of Ruby on Rails is the most amazing thing I have ever felt with my fingertips... I felt like that just got kind of weird so lets put a gif to make up for it.

There we go, now back to what I was saying. SO Ruby on Rails is amazing! I am loving this CRU Rails Lab it is so powerful using the rails generators! Now we can create Databases, Models, Controllers, Views, Add Columns, Change Columns, Remove Columns, Form_For tags... I mean this is some amazing things that we used to have to manually do every single time and now we can user a Generator to do almost everything for us when the circumstances `permit`! ;) 

Give Yourself a hand you have learned some amazing things thus far and if this is halway I can't wait to see what Badass Lessons we will have in the Future! Continue kicking ass and never give up! Enjoy the curriculum I know I am!
