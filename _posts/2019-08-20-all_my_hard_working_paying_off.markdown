October 23rd of 2018 was the day that started my journey with Flatiron. I am so grateful to have found such an amazing curriculum to push me to not only be able to code but to THINK like a developer. I have noticed my mind has hundreds of new compartments or should I say Components ;) That's how you know you're a programmer is when you start making lame Programming vocabulary jokes haha! With all these new Components I have been able to successfuly build my Final Project, my own Yelp Clone.

My Yelp Clone has been my favorite project by far! I have enjoyed every second of all the knowledge that I have gathered up to now, coming together to create a SPA that I am very proud of! Not only am I able to write code, but I understand what is going on under the hood! There is nothing like all the hard work you have been putting in to pay off. What I would tell myself in the beginning that I did not truly comprehend until now is that there is nothing that beats hard work. The satisfaction you get when you can program an app that you're not embarrrased to show someone is a feeling that will never get old to me. Programming has done much more than provide me with experience to be able to land a job but it has made my brain feel so alive! I know I am not the only one who gets a euphoric high when your code all comes together. Files upon files coming together, in perfect harmony. 

What I want you to take away from this is that you should never give up no matter how hard it gets. You should be happy that it gets hard because when you hurdle that obstacle you get the biggest sense of accomplishment and ooooooooooooooo does that feel AMAZING! Flatiron will by far be one of my favorite experiences of my life and I owe them everything! Thank you Flatiron and THANK GOD FOR AVI!
